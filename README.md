Arduitunes
==========

Poliphonic chiptune music player. An arduino, a speaker and you're done! Play the presets or make your own.

<h3>You will need</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>An arduino UNO board</strong><br>
  <p>I haven't tested this on other arduino boards, but it is most unlikely to work, say, on a Mega since the program edits directly some registers that have different meanings depending on the board you're using.</p></li>
<li><strong>A speaker or an audio jack connector</strong><br>
  <p>If you choose to use a speaker, choose a little one, like a piezo speaker, one from old headphones, those you can take apart from toys, etc.</p>
  <p>If you want to play the music on your subwoofer, headphones, or other, you can use an audio jack connector, wich is basicly this stuff:</p>

<li><strong>Some resistors</strong>
<p>One 330 立 resistor for each voice, two 330 立 resistors for current limiting on the leds and one 1 k立 resistor for volume limiting. You can use different but similar values of resistors if you want.</p></li>
<li><strong>2 potentiometers</strong>
<p>I reccomend 2 10k立 pots.</p></li>
<li><strong>Two leds</strong></li>
<br>
</ul>

<h3>How to use</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the project (arduitunes.ino)</li>
<li>Set things up in your protoboard</li>
<li>Connect your arduino Uno and load the program</li>
<li>Enjoy the pokemon battle theme</li>
</ol>
<h3>Making your own music</h3>
<p>In order to play musical notes, Arduitunes parses strings in real time. These strings must fit some protocol I came up with while programming. Directly writting the music into the program would be a pain in the bottom.</p>
<p>This is why I made an <a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~acastro/arduitunes">ugly but functional web app</a> wich is a graphical user interface where you can make Arduitune-compatible tunes. This is what I used to create the song you just heard. Check it out! (I'm aware of my lack of web designing skills).</p>
<p>When you're ready editing your song, click <em>"Generar"</em>. Go to <em>Arduitunes.ino</em>. In the beggining you'll see three preset tunes: <em>Mario Bros, Pokemon Battle</em> and <em>Shingeki</em>. To select a preset melody simply uncomment the whole thing. Make sure there's <strong>only one</strong> melody selected, i.e. comment the ones you're not using.</p>
<p>To play your custom made music, comment any uncommented melody, copy the code generated by the web app and paste it somewhere between the <pre>/*##################### PRESET MELODYS ####################*/</pre> and the <pre>/*################### END PRESET MELODYS ##################*/</pre>Compile, load to the arduino and enjoy.</p>
<p>The webpage's source is also available for editing. Feel free to make it prettier.</p>

<p>This was made entirely for fun and for supporting my learning process. Please don't expect much. </p>
<p>Thanks for checking my arduino project!</p>
